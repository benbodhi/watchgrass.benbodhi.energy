# WATCH GRASS

## A p5.js art experiment

Use it: [https://watchgrass.benbodhi.energy](https://watchgrass.benbodhi.energy)

This is my first experiment with making generative art using p5.js

Make and watch the grass grow, generate countless random combinations of blades of grass and export your favourites.

## The NFT

I dropped this generator as an NFT on Zora!
**[MINT IT](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x339d3cf921ef7fa5e9727c6f1f958279486e94be/1?referrer=0xa903C06BF35286f6d1cDAD25396748353979a44C)**

One day I might figure out how to make this into an NFT that mints the contents of the canvas so collectors can generate their own grass.
