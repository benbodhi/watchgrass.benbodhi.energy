# WATCH GRASS

## A p5.js art experiment

Use it: [https://watchgrass.benbodhi.energy](https://watchgrass.benbodhi.energy)

This is my first experiment with making generative art using p5.js

Make and watch the grass grow, generate countless random combinations of blades of grass and export your favourites.

## The NFT

I minted this generator as an NFT on Zora!

One day I might figure out how to make tthis into an NFT that mints the contents of the canvas so collectors can generate their own grass.
